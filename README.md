# Dhivvyesh Kumar

I am an aspiring AI and Data Science enthusiast passionate about building responsible, human-centered technology. My work focuses on using data and machine learning not just for prediction, but for impact—especially in the fields of waste management and sustainability. I believe that fairness, explainability, and transparency are essential to any system meant to serve people.

## Featured Project

### College Admission Predictor  
A full-stack machine learning project that predicts student college admissions based on academic, extracurricular, and socio-demographic features.  
It applies ethical AI principles using SHAP analysis, fairness audits (by income, school type, and parental education), and class balancing (SMOTE), with real model evaluation using scikit-learn.
